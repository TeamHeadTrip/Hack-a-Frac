# Hack-a-Frac
Virtual reality educational fractions game for Hack For Change 2016

Teaches kids an abstract idea in a kinesthetic and engaging way. Would like to scale up to more difficult abstract math concepts but I am both limited in my math skills and want something small in scope.

Fractions is an easy place to start, but virtual reality can be used to kinesthetically enhance all kinds of math concepts. Math can be very abstract sometimes. Certain kinds of math can be taught kinesthetically with props, but more abstract ideas can not, and virtual reality can not only serve those more abstract functions, it can teach those less abstract ideas with great visual punch and interactive engagement.

I'm a UX Designer here in Austin. I've been involved in the VR scene for about 3 years. I just got my own HMD (an HTC Vive), and I'm very interested in it's educational/therapeutic potential. I'd also be open to other VR pitches (particularly educational ones).
